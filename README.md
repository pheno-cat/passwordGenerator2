# passwordGenerator2

A password is randomly generated based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password", they are first prompted for password length. If outside 8-128 range, the user is prompted to once again enter a password lengthw within the required range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The program then prompts the user to define whether they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.

When all parameters have been satisfied, the password will appear!
